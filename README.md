# Disclaimer
This script doesn use ajax for anything and in later versions will use React for this...
# Attributes
class="ajaxify-add" // allows to search for intended targets to be used as ajaxify sources, meaning that this source does a post request to the backend
ajaxify-csrf="csrf token" // Only needs to be set once in the application, and allows you to communicate with protected backend
ajaxify-url="https://localhost:80/" // The target url where the ajaxify source is targetting.
